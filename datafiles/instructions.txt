Freeze and slice the steak:
Place steak in the freezer on a sheet pan for about 10 minutes so it gets very cold but not frozen through.
Trim off any large pieces of fat normally around the edges of the steak, but some veins of fat in the middle of the steak are good. Slice the steak as thin as possible with a sharp knife. You won’t be able to get it paper thin without a meat slicer, but think of thick deli cut meat. Season steak with salt and pepper.
Cook the onions and peppers:
In a large skillet set over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil along with sliced onions and peppers. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions and peppers have softened and start to caramelize around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Don’t rush them!
Cook the steak:
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the sliced steak. Spread out the steak in the skillet in a thin even layer so it covers as much surface area as possible. Cook for a minute or two and then stir to finish cooking the steak. It might need another minute or two, but it will cook very quickly.
Finishing the cheesesteak:
Turn heat down to low on the steak and add the peppers and onions to the steak mixture and stir to combine. Add the provolone slices to the top of the steak mixture and let the cheese melt. Stir to combine, once the cheese has melted.
Assemble the cheesesteaks and serve:
Evenly scoop the cheesesteak mixture into the toasted hoagie rolls. The hoagie rolls should be packed! Optionally, drizzle the cheesesteaks with warm Cheez Whiz for maximum cheesiness. Sprinkle fresh thyme over top and serve.
Preheat the oven, prepare two baking sheets:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with heavy duty aluminum foil—one for the bacon and other to assemble the sandwiches, it should be large enough to set two slices of bread side by side.
Cook the bacon:
Lay the bacon slices on one of the baking sheets.
Cook the bacon, until crispy and to your liking, rotating the pan halfway through cooking if necessary, and checking for doneness at about 12 minutes.
Transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess grease.
Toast the bread and assemble the sandwiches:
Toast 4 slices of bread in a toaster, toaster oven, or regular oven.
On the remaining baking sheet place two slices of toast side by side in a single layer. Cut the other two slices of toast on a diagonal to form triangles and set those pieces aside.
Cut four slices of tomato. Divide the turkey evenly between the slices of toast on the baking sheet. Top each stack of turkey with two slices of tomato. Season with salt and pepper.
Make the cheese sauce:
Set a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter. Once it melts, slowly whisk in the flour and continue to whisk until the mixture turns a shade darker and begins to smell slightly nutty, about 1 minute. This will allow the raw flour taste to cook out.
Slowly pour in the milk and cream, whisking constantly, until the mixture is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes. When you first start pouring in the liquid, it will look ugly and grainy. Don't worry! It will calm down, come back together and smooth itself out once all of the liquid is whisked in.
Remove from heat and add the cheese:
Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Whisk to combine until the cheese melts. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary, keeping in mind the saltiness of your turkey.
Spoon half of the sauce over each sandwich.
Broil the sandwiches:
Set the oven rack about 5 inches from the broiler element. Preheat the broiler. Broil the sandwiches until the sauce is browned in spots and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.
Serve the sandwiches:
With a spatula, transfer each sandwich and two triangles of toast to a plate. Spoon the remaining sauce from the baking dish onto the plates.
Crisscross 2 slices of bacon over top each sandwich and garnish with parsley. Serve while still hot.
Cook the onion and peppers:
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the paprika, cumin, and pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds to a minute to bloom the spices.
Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper, and yellow pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.
Crush the tomatoes and simmer them with the peppers:
In a bowl, break up the tomatoes with your hands. Add them to the skillet with the salt and cook for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if you prefer.
Cook the eggs:
With the back of a spoon or a ladle, make 4 indentations in the sauce.
Break an egg into a cup and carefully pour it into and indentation, being careful not to break the yolk. Repeat with the remaining eggs. (You can crack the egg directly into the sauce and skip the cup, but it’s easier to get a an errant egg shell or protect the dish from a bad egg if you use the cup method.)
Sprinkle the feta and olives around the eggs. Cover the pan and simmer over medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still soft. (If you like your eggs well done, cook for a minute or two longer.)
To serve:
Garnish with cilantro leaves and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. Bring to the table and serve from the pan.
Cook the steak:
Heat a couple teaspoons of oil in a cast iron pan on high heat. Pat the steaks dry. Sprinkle the steaks on both sides with a little salt.
Sear the steaks in the pan on both sides, just until nicely browned. Remove pan from heat and cover. Let cook for a few minutes more, until the steak is done to your liking.
You can test with a meat thermometer. Remove steak from pan at 125°F to 130°F for rare, 140°F for medium rare, 150° for medium. Or use your fingers to test the meat for doneness (see
The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat
).
Let the steak rest before cutting, then cut thin slices:
Remove from pan to a cutting board. Let rest for a few minutes before cutting. Cut thin slices, on a diagonal so you slice wide pieces, across the grain of the meat.
Make the salads:
Toss together the lettuce greens, arugula, bell pepper, goat cheese, and scallions. Arrange on individual plates. Sprinkle with avocado. Lay on top several slices of chilled sliced steak. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds or sliced kumquats if using.
Make dressing:
Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle on salad.
Combine salad ingredients:
Combine the lettuce, red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and scallions in a large serving bowl. Set aside.
Char the corn:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium or large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the corn.
Season corn with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until blackened in spots and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Season the chicken:
Sprinkle the taco seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon salt over the surface of the chicken, rubbing it in and coating so chicken is fully seasoned.
Cook the chicken:
In the same skillet used to cook the corn add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook until deeply brown along the bottom and the flesh turns opaque about halfway up the side, 4 to 5 minutes.
Flip the chicken and continue cooking, until brown on the second side and fully cooked through, another 3 to 5 minutes.
Cut the chicken:
Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board. Once it is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-sized pieces.
Make the salad dressing:
Place the lime juice, vinegar, honey, cumin, salt, pepper, cilantro, and olive oil into a blender and blend until smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of water, if needed, to get the blender going.
Alternatively, make this dressing by hand. Finely chop the cilantro and place in a medium bowl. Combine all salad dressing ingredients and whisk until smooth.
Finish and serve the salad:
Add the corn and chicken into the bowl with the salad ingredients. Crumble the tortilla chips over the top.
Add about two-thirds of the dressing and toss to lightly coat. Add more dressing and toss again, if needed. Divide salad into 4 bowls, top with crumbled Cotija cheese, and serve.
Marinate the lamb:
Rub rib rack(s) all over with mixture of rosemary, thyme, and garlic. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Place in a thick plastic bag with olive oil.
Spread oil around so that it coats the lamb rack(s) all over. Squeeze out as much air as you can from the bag and seal. Place in a container so that if the bag leaks, the container catches the leak.
Marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours as the lamb is coming to room temperature in the next step.
Bring lamb to room temp:
Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 1 1/2 to 2 hours before you cook it so that it comes to room temp. If the meat is not at room temperature it won't cook evenly and may still be raw inside while the outside is cooked.
Preheat the oven to 450°F:
Arrange the oven rack so that the lamb will be in the middle of the oven.
Score the fat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap bones in foil, place in pan fat side up:
Score the fat, by making sharp shallow cuts through the fat, spaced about an inch apart.
Sprinkle the rack all over with salt and pepper. Place the lamb rack bone side down (fat side up) on a roasting pan lined with foil. Wrap the exposed rib bones in a little foil so that they don't burn.
Roast at high heat to brown, then reduce to finish:
Place the roast in the oven roast at 450°F for 10 minutes (longer if roasting more than one rack), or until the surface of the roast is nicely browned.
Then lower the heat to 300°F. Cook for 10-20 minutes longer (depending on the size of the lamb rack, if you are roasting more than one rack, and how rare or well done you want your lamb), until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat 125°F on a for rare or 135°F for medium rare.
Use a meat thermometer.
Many factors can affect cooking time like the shape of the roast, the fat marbling, and your individual oven characteristics. This is too lovely and tender a roast to risk overcooking.
Rest the roast, then slice and serve:
Remove from oven, cover with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.
Cut lamb chops away from the rack by slicing between the bones. Serve 2-3 chops per person.
Prepare the baking sheets:
Line a large baking sheet with paper towels, have another baking sheet ready and a weight like a jar of sugar or flour.
Press the tofu:
Drain tofu and dry with paper towels.
Arrange the tofu in a single layer on the baking sheet lined with paper towels. Cover with additional paper towels. Place a second sheet pan on top. Place a heavy can or jar on the pan to lightly press out the excess moisture from the tofu. Leave it for about 10 minutes.
Dry the tofu:
After pressing, use dry paper towels to gently pat each piece of tofu dry to remove as much residual moisture as possible. Set the pieces aside on dry paper towels.
Make the sauce:
In a medium-sized bowl whisk together orange juice, vegetable broth, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, and garlic chili sauce. In a small bowl whisk together cornstarch and water, set aside.
Fry the tofu:
Heat a wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 teaspoons vegetable oil and sesame oil and heat until shimmering but not smoking. Swirl the pan to coat with the oil.
Working in two batches, add tofu to the pan in a single layer. Cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip over and cook the other side until golden browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate lined with a paper towel, then fry the remaining tofu.
Stir-fry the vegetables:
Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the pan. Add the mushrooms and sugar snap peas, stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the diced bell peppers, cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger, stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Cook the sauce:
Add the sauce mixture to the pan, simmer for 30 seconds. Mix the cornstarch mixture, then gradually add to the pan, stir constantly until thickened, about 30 seconds.
Add the tofu back to the pan:
Turn off the heat and add the tofu back to the pan, stir to coat and warm through, about 1 minute. Season tofu stir-fry with salt, pepper, and garlic chili oil to taste.
Serve:
Serve tofu stir-fry with rice and garnish with green onions.
Simmer pomegranate juice and sugar:
In a small saucepan, combine the pomegranate juice and sugar and whisk until dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium-low so that you have a vigorous simmer. The liquid should have lots of little bubbles around the edges, but no big bubbles.
Simmer to reduce pomegranate liquid:
Continue to simmer until the mixture has reduced to about a third, there should be 1 2/3 cup of liquid remaining. This can take anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes, and the liquid should be viscous and have thickened to the consistency of honey.
Let grenadine cool to room temperature:
After the mixture has reduced, remove from the heat and let it come to room temperature. Stir in the orange flower water and pomegranate molasses. If using, also stir in the vodka.
Store the grenadine:
Pour the grenadine into an airtight container or swing top bottle. Store in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 months.
Rinse and slice the cucumbers:
Carefully rinse the cucumbers, scrubbing away any dirt that may have stuck to the ribs. Slice off 1/8-inch from the ends and discard. Slice the cucumbers in 1/4-inch thick slices, place in a large bowl.
Salt, chill, and drain the cucumber slices:
Add the sliced onions and all of the pickling salt. Stir in so that the salt is well distributed among the cucumber slices. Cover with a clean tea towel (thin towel, not terry cloth). Cover with a couple of inches of ice.
Put in the
refrigerator
and let chill for 4 hours. Discard ice. Rinse the cucumber and onion slices thoroughly, drain. Rinse and drain again.
Sterilize the jars:
If you are planning to store your pickles outside of the refrigerator for any length of time, you will need to sterilize your jars before canning, and heat the filled jars in a hot water bath after canning.
If you are planning to eat the pickles right away and store them the whole time in the refrigerator, you can skip the water bath step. It's still a good idea to sterilize the jars first, you can do that by running them through the dishwasher, or placing them in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.
To sterilize the jars for canning, place empty jars on a metal rack in a large, 16-qt canning pot. (Jars must rest on a rack in the pot, not on the bottom of the pot). Fill with warm water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to warm to keep the jars hot and ready for canning.
Remove with tongs or jar lifters one by one as you can the cucumbers.
Sterilize the lids by bringing a pot of water to a boil and pouring water over a bowl containing the lids.
Make pickling syrup:
In a 4 qt or 6 qt pot, place the vinegar, sugar, and all of the pickling spices. (Do not add salt.) Bring to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the sliced cucumbers and onions. Bring to a boil again. As soon as the sugar vinegar solution begins boiling again, use a slotted spoon to start packing the hot jars with the cucumbers and onions.
Pack jars, add pickling syrup:
Pack jars to an inch from the rim with the cucumbers and onions. Then pour hot vinegar sugar syrup over them to a half inch from the rim.
Wipe the rim clean with a paper towel. Place a sterilized lid on the jar. Secure with a metal screw band.
Process in hot water bath:
If you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, you will want to process the filled jars in a hot water bath.
Return filled jars to the same canning pot with its already hot water. Water level needs to be at least one inch above the top of the cans.
Bring to a boil and let boil hard for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes for altitudes of 1001 to 6,000 feet. Over 6,000 feet, boil for 25 minutes. Remove jars from pot.
Let cool down to room temperature. Jars should make a popping sound as their lids seal. If a lid doesn't properly seal, do not store the jar outside of the refrigerator.
Make the dredging station and prepare baking sheet:
You will need two large shallow dishes. One for the dry ingredients and one for the wet ingredients.
In the first shallow dish, use a whisk to combine the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt and pepper.
In the second shallow dish, whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce, eggs, and salt. Place a piece of parchment paper or wax paper on a large baking sheet.
Arrange them on your counter dry, wet, baking sheet.
Dredge and dip the chicken:
Dredge a piece of chicken in the dry flour mixture, making sure to flip the chicken to coat both sides.
Dip the chicken in the wet buttermilk mixture, making sure to coat both sides. Letting the excess drain off. Dip the chicken back into the flour mixture again, coating both sides. Move to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the chicken.
Let the chicken rest while you heat the oil in the next step. This will help the coating adhere to the chicken.
Heat the oil to 350°F:
Pour enough oil into a large deep skillet or Dutch oven (at least 3-inches tall) so the oil depth is at least 2-inches deep.
Heat the oil on high until it reaches 350°F. If you don’t have an instant read thermometer or deep frying/candy thermometer, drop a 1-inch cube of bread in the oil. If it goes golden brown in about 45 seconds, you’re at the right temperature.
Fry the chicken:
Once the oil is hot enough, gently slide two or three pieces of the chicken into the pan using tongs. Use your tongs to place half the chicken in the oil, then release it so it slides the rest of the way in. If you drop the chicken in the skillet, it’s more likely to splatter the oil and potentially burn you.
Fry the chicken for about 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting the heat lower or higher to maintain 350°F. Be sure to flip the chicken halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking. The chicken will be done when it is golden brown, and the internal temperature of the chicken is 165°F (160°F for white meat).
Once done, move the fry pieces to a wire rack placed on a baking sheet or a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, frying in batches.
Let oil cool:
When all the chicken is finished, let the oil cool down for 5 to 10 minutes. You will need some of it to make the spicy paste.
Make the spicy paste:
Place the butter in medium sized microwave-safe glass bowl. Carefully ladle and measure out 1/2 cup of the hot oil and pour it over the butter. Stir to help the butter melt. If the butter hasn’t melted, cover the bowl and microwave the mixture in 10 second increments until the butter is melted.
Add the cayenne pepper, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper to the bowl, then stir to form a paste. The paste will be vary in texture, depending on how much cayenne and brown sugar you use, with more spice and sugar creating a thicker paste.
You want the paste to be similar to thin BBQ sauce, something you can easily brush on but is still thick enough to cling to the chicken. I used 4 tablespoons of cayenne and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. You can adjust the thickness by adding more oil if you need.
Assemble and serve the sandwich:
Place one piece of chicken on the bottom of a burger bun. Brush the chicken with the spicy paste, making sure to coat the entire piece of chicken. Garnish with some pickles and then top with the bun. Serve immediately.
Make the dredging station and prepare baking sheet:
You will need two large shallow dishes. One for the dry ingredients and one for the wet ingredients.

Chill the coupe glasses:
Put a handful of ice and some water into two 4-ounce coupe glasses to chill.
Peel and juice the lemon:
With a Y-shaped vegetable peeler, peel 2 swaths of lemon rind from end to end, about 3 inches long. With the tip of a paring knife, cut a slit (about 1 inch) in the middle of each lemon peel between the long ends making sure not to cut through the entire peel.
Squeeze the juice into a pourable container. You’ll use it later.
Muddle the cucumber and basil:
Into a cocktail shaker add the cucumber and basil. Using a muddler or the handle of a wooden spoon press lightly; crush and bruise the cucumber and basil to release the oils and juices.
Add the spirits, simple syrup, and bitter to the shaker:
Add the gin, 1 ounce of lemon juice, simple syrup, Lillet, bitters, and salt into the cocktail shaker. Fill the shaker halfway with ice and shake to chill, 20 to 30 seconds.
Assemble, garnish, and serve cocktail:
Discard the ice water in the coupe glasses. Strain the cocktail evenly into the chilled glasses. Secure the lemon peels on the rim of each glass for garnish. Serve.
Combine ingredients in blender:
Combine Blanco tequila, simple syrup, Cointreau, lime juice, lime zest, and ice in a blender or food processor.
Blend the cocktail:
Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Rim glasses and serve:
Pour salt onto a plate that is slightly larger than your cocktail glass.
Take a piece of lime and generously rub it around the rim of your glass. Dip the outside rim of your glass into the salt. Repeat with other glass.
Pour frozen margaritas into glasses and serve.
Pour ingredients into cocktail shaker:
Pour the pisco, lime juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white into a cocktail shaker. Dry shake (without ice) for at least 15 seconds to fully emulsify the egg white. Shaking with the coil from a Hawthorne strainer, if you have it, will help whisk and emulsify the egg white further.
Add ice and shake to chill:
Add ice to the shaker and vigorously shake for another 10 seconds before straining into a chilled coupe or old-fashioned glass.
Add a dash of bitters, garnish, and serve:
Using a dropper, dot the top of the drink with three drops of bitters. Garnish with a dusting of cinnamon. Serve.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Combine the cake flour and powdered sugar:
Sift together the cake flour and powdered sugar into a bowl or a piece of parchment.
Begin whisking the egg whites by hand:
In the bowl of a stand mixer, add egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, and the vanilla and almond extracts. Hold the whisk of the stand mixer in your hand. Manually and aggressively whisk the egg whites for about a minute. This just helps get everything started.
Continue whisking the egg whites with a mixer:
Set the bowl into the stand mixer base fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk at medium speed until the egg whites have thickened and are frothy, about one minute.
Continue whipping at medium speed, and slowly sprinkle the granulated sugar over the whipped egg whites a little at a time, until the sugar is incorporated and the eggs are white, shiny, and hold medium stiff peaks.
To test this, stop the mixer, detach the whisk and the bowl from the mixer. Lift the mixer out of the egg whites, and turn it upside down. A short tip of egg white should fall over when you pull the whisk from the bowl.
Fold in the flour mixture:
Remove the bowl of the stand mixer from the base, and slowly shake the flour a little a time, about a 1/4 of the flour, over the surface of the egg whites. Use a spatula to fold the flour into the egg whites. Repeat this process until all of the flour is incorporated.
Bake:
Scoop the mixture into an un-greased angel food cake pan. Bake for 40 minutes. The top should be springy, dry, golden, and slightly cracked.
Cool the cake upside down:
Let the cake cool upside down on a bottle or the feet of the pan for 90 minutes to 2 hours. This allows the cake to cool and maintain its structure. If you flip the cake over too soon, it will compress or collapse.
Once the cake pan is completely cool to the touch and you’ve patiently waited at least 90 minutes, slide a knife around the edges and the center tube. Turn it upside down. Remove the base from the sides. The cake will still be attached to the base. Slide a knife between the base and the cake.
Serve:
Eat with berries, whipped cream, or out of hand while standing in the kitchen. Store covered on the counter for up to a week.
Make the smoothie:
Throw all of the ingredients into your blender, and blast on high for 30 to 60 seconds until smooth and creamy.
Make the polenta:
Bring the water and salt for the polenta to a boil over medium heat in a 2-quart saucepan. Once it's boiling, add the polenta and whisk until the polenta is fully incorporated.
Lower the heat (as low as it can go) and cook the polenta for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes with a whisk to break up any clumps.
Roast the broccoli:
Heat your oven to 425 ̊F. Arrange the chopped broccoli on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and salt. Roast until the broccoli is tender and beginning to char, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Make the bean puree:
While the polenta and broccoli are cooking, combine the drained beans with the olive oil, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor or in a high speed blender. Puree until smooth, adding a few tablespoons of water as needed to help smooth it out.
When the polenta is done cooking, stir the bean puree into the polenta.
Make the chili oil:
Heat the oil in a small skillet. Add the chili flakes, remove from the heat, and let it rest until ready to serve. (You can make this ahead of time!)
Assemble the bowls:
Divide the polenta among four bowls. Top with the broccoli and a drizzle of the chili oil.
Heat the chicken stock:
In a medium pot add the chicken stock and bring it up to a gentle simmer.
Brown the chicken:
In a large (8-quart or larger) thick-bottomed pot, heat the butter or olive oil over medium-high heat. Pat dry the chicken pieces and sprinkle with salt.
Working in batches, brown the chicken pieces, placing the pieces skin-side down first; this will render out fat you will use to build the stew later.
Poach the chicken in the stock:
Once the chicken pieces are browned on all sides, remove them from the large pot, and turn off the heat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken pieces and put the chicken pieces into the pot of simmering stock.
Poach the chicken in the stock until cooked through, about 20 minutes or so.
Remove the chicken pieces and set on a tray to cool for a few minutes. When the chicken pieces are cool to touch, pull the meat off the bones and cut into 2-inch chunks. Set aside.
Cook the vegetables until softened:
Return the heat on the large pot to medium-high. When the pot is hot, add the onion, celery, carrot and thyme and sauté until soft, but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the flour:
and stir well. The flour will absorb the fat in the pot and will stick a little to the bottom. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the flour vegetable mixture constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let it burn.
Add sherry, slowly add stock:
Get a ladle ready and have the pot of simmering chicken stock nearby. Add the sherry to the flour vegetable mixture. It will sputter and seize up.
Add a ladle of hot chicken stock and stir well. It will be goopy. Add another ladle, then another, stirring all the while, until the broth comes together.
Add the rest of the chicken stock and the reserved chicken meat. Increase the heat and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer while you make the dumplings.
Make the dumpling batter:
Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add (optional) chopped fresh herbs. Add melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients.
Gently mix with a wooden spoon until mixture just comes together. (Note: do not over-mix or your dumplings will turn out too dense.)
Add dumplings to the stew:
Drop dumpling batter into the simmering stew by heaping teaspoonfuls, over the surface of the stew. (Note that the dumplings will easily double in size as they cook.) Cover and simmer until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Once you have covered the pan, do
not
uncover and peek while the dumplings are cooking! In order for the dumplings to be light and fluffy, they must steam, not boil. Uncovering the pan releases the steam.
If after 15 minutes the dumplings are still not cooked through (use a toothpick or skewer to test), then cover pan again and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.
Finish the stew:
Gently stir in peas, parsley, and cream, if using. Add more salt to taste. Ladle portions of meat, sauce, vegetables, and dumplings into soup plates and serve. Note that the stew will continue to thicken the longer it sits.
Brown the roast on all sides:
Use a thick-bottomed covered pot (ovenproof if you intend to cook in oven), such as a Dutch oven, just large enough to hold roast and vegetables. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil on medium high heat (hot enough to sear the meat).
Pat the roast dry with paper towels. Sprinkle and rub salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning all over the meat. Brown roast in pot, all over, several minutes on each side. Don't move the roast while a side is browning, or it won't brown well.
Brown the onions, add garlic, carrots:
When roast is browned, remove from pan and set on a plate. Add the onions to the pan and cook for about 5 to 10 minutes, until they begin to brown. Add the garlic and carrots to sit on top of the onions.
Add roast and simmer:
Set the roast on top of the onions, garlic and carrots. Add 1/2 cup of red wine. Add the bay leaf and cover.
Bring to simmer and then adjust the heat down to the lowest heat possible to maintain a
bare simmer
when covered (we cook our roast on the
warm
setting of our electric range).
Tip:
If you use a gas range, you may find difficulty getting the flame low enough to maintain a bare simmer. In this case, roll up some aluminum foil tightly, shape it into a donut, and put it on top of the burner to create a little more distance between the range and the pan. If you use a high-BTU range, you may want to cook the roast in the oven instead.
(If cooking in the oven, bring to a simmer first on the stovetop, then put in the oven, start the temp at 350°F for 15 minutes, then drop it to 250°F for the next hour, and then to 225°F after that.)
Cook several hours until fork tender and serve:
Cook for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours, or longer, until meat is tender.
After 3 1/2 hours, the meat will release a lot of liquid, which comes from slow cooking at a very low temperature. If your pot roast is too dry, make sure the pan you are using has a tight fitting lid and that you are cooking at the lowest possible heat to maintain the low simmer.
Serve with green beans and potatoes.
Brown the oxtails:
Pat the oxtails dry with paper towels and sprinkle them on all sides with salt. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 5 to 6-quart, thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium-high to high heat. Working in batches, add the oxtails to the pan, fat side down. Add more oil as needed with additional batches of oxtails. Do not crowd the pan.
Let them get well browned on one side before flipping over with tongs. Brown well on all sides. Remove to a large bowl.
Sauté the vegetables:
Add the onions, celery, and carrots to the pot. Sauté until translucent and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pot to a bowl, cover and set aside.
Deglaze the pan:
Add the bottle of wine to the pot. Increase the heat to as high as it will go, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Boil the wine, uncovered, until it is reduced to about a cup.
Simmer the oxtails 2 1/2 hours:
Return the oxtails to the pot (but not the vegetables). Add the stock and enough water to just cover them. Add the thyme. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, covered.
Simmer on the stovetop for 2 1/2 hours. (You can also place the simmering oxtails in a 350°F oven for the same amount of time if the oven is more convenient.)
Add the vegetables:
Add the vegetables back to the pot and simmer 30 minutes longer.
Chill overnight:
Remove the pot from heat and let cool. Chill in the refrigerator overnight so that the flavors blend and the fat on the surface solidifies, making it easier to remove. You can skip this step, but the oxtails will be better if they are chilled in this state overnight.
Remove excess fat:
The next day, remove the pot from the refrigerator and scrape off the layer of rendered fat that has solidified on top of the oxtails. If you are not waiting for the oxtails to chill, the fat still needs to be removed. If working with a room temperature or warm pot, use a fat separator or a large metal spoon to skim away the fat.
Reheat, remove meat from bones:
Heat the oxtails on medium heat. Cook uncovered for about another half an hour, or until the meat can easily be pulled off the bones. Then use a slotted spoon to remove the oxtails from the pot. Let cool enough to touch. Use your hands to remove the meat from the bones to a bowl. Take care to remove as well the round tough cartilage caps on either end of the vertebrae.
Strain and reduce the sauce:
(Optional, if you want a smoother glaze) While the oxtails are cooling in the step above, strain the mixture in the pot, discarding the solids and returning the liquid to the pot. Increase the heat to high to bring the liquid to a boil.
Simmer meat until sauce reduces to a glaze:
When the liquid has reduced by about a half, add the oxtail meat back to the pot. Bring to a boil, continue to boil away the liquid until it has reduced to a light syrupy consistency.
As the mixture boils down, you may want to reduce the heat to a simmer, and stir the oxtails a little so that the glaze doesn't burn and so that the meat doesn't stick to the pan. When the right consistency, remove from heat and serve.

In a food processor, combine the onion and garlic. Pulse until well chopped.
Add the tomatoes, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, lime zest, salt, cumin, and sugar. Pulse until combined but still chunky.
The consistency of this salsa varies depending on the water content of the tomatoes. If it’s too watery, strain half to remove some of the liquid. Combine the chunky strained mixture with the remaining salsa. If you still prefer a chunkier texture, strain out more of the liquid to reach your desired consistency.
In a small food processor, combine the oil, lime juice, chipotle, honey, garlic, cumin, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Pulse until combined.

Place the beans in a large colander and sort through them to remove and discard any stones or debris. Rinse them well and transfer them to a large bowl. Cover with 2 to 3 inches of water and discard any beans that float. Soak at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse.
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. If you like spicy beans, add the jalapeño with the onion.
Stir in the cumin and then add the beans, water, oregano, salt, and several grinds of pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender. The timing will depend on the freshness of your beans. I like to check mine starting at 1 hour and every 15 minutes after that. Add more liquid to the pot, as needed, to keep the beans submerged. I like to cook my pinto beans until they’re starting to fall apart and the bean liquid around them has thickened.
Turn off the heat and stir in the lime juice. Season the beans to taste with more salt (I typically add ½ to 1 additional teaspoon), more pepper, and chili powder, if desired. Garnish with cilantro, if using. Store the beans in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months.
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Place the cauliflower and cabbage on a large sheet pan. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the cumin, coriander, and salt. Use your hands to mix everything together and spread it out into an even layer. Roast, stirring every 15 minutes, until the vegetables are softened and browned in spots, about 45 minutes. (I roasted my cabbage and cauliflower on two separate sheet pans. I cooked the cauliflower for 25 minutes and the cabbage for 10 minutes. Both ways work!)
Evenly divide the Avocado Sauce and roasted vegetables among the tortillas. Serve immediately with the radishes, serranos, avocado slices, and cilantro, if using.
Place the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, mayonnaise, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. If your sauce is too thick, add water, ½ tablespoon at a time, to thin it to your desired consistency. Season to taste with more salt as needed.
If you don't have a food processor, place the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, mayonnaise, and salt in a medium bowl, and use a fork or potato masher to mash until the ingredients are combined. If you prefer a thinner sauce, add water, ½ tablespoon at a time, to thin it to your desired consistency. Season to taste.
Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat. In a medium bowl, toss the onions with drizzles of olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Grill the onions for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until char marks form and the onions are tender.
Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed and warm water and set aside to thicken for 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, stir together the oat flour, the additional 1 cup rolled oats, almond flour, lemon zest, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
In a medium bowl, combine the almond butter, coconut oil, and maple syrup and stir well to incorporate. Stir in the flaxseed mixture.
Add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and fold in just until combined. Fold in the walnuts and blueberries.
Scoop ¼ cup of batter for each cookie onto the baking sheet. Bake 20 to 24 minutes, or until browned around the edges. Cool on the pan for 5 to 10 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. If you take them off the sheet too soon, the cookies may fall apart.
When cookies are completely cool, they can be stored in an airtight container or frozen.
Prepare the mushrooms by removing the stems and cleaning the caps with a damp cloth or paper towel. Place the mushrooms in a rimmed plate and drizzle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, tamari, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to help coat the mushrooms on both sides.
Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Place the mushrooms, gill side up onto the grill pan. Cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until mushrooms are tender.
Place the mushrooms onto the buns and serve with desired fixings.
Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread the almonds in an even layer on the baking sheet and toast for 10 minutes, or until fragrant. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.
Transfer the toasted almonds to a medium food processor. Process until very smooth, stopping every 30 seconds to 1 minute to scape down the sides of the bowl, as necessary, and to give the food processor's motor a break. The mixture will be chunky at first. Then, it'll thicken into a ball, and finally, it will become creamy and smooth. The whole process should take about 15 minutes.
If the almond butter still isn't coming together after 15 minutes, add avocado oil, 1 teaspoon at a time, to help the mixture blend.
Season to taste with salt, and serve on toast,
overnight oats
,
oatmeal
, yogurt, or
banana bread

Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the garlic and salt and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice. Season with freshly ground pepper and sprinkle with parsley and red pepper flakes, if using.
Serve with steamed artichokes for dipping or toss with pasta. See the blog post above for additional serving suggestions.
Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed and warm water and set aside to thicken for 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, stir together the oat flour, the additional 1 cup rolled oats, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
In a medium bowl, combine the carrots, almond butter, coconut oil, and maple syrup, and vanilla and stir well. Add the flaxseed mixture and stir well to incorporate.
Add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and fold in just until combined. Fold in the walnuts.
Scoop ¼ cup of batter for each cookie onto the baking sheets. Bake, one sheet at a time, for 20 to 24 minutes, or until browned around the edges. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
When cookies are completely cool, pipe with cream cheese frosting, if desired.
Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper and spread evenly onto the baking sheet. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until browned around the edges.
Season to taste with more salt and pepper and toss with lemon zest and parsley. Or keep it plain and use it in any recipe that calls for roasted cauliflower.
Place a box grater on a cutting board. Pick up a carrot by its thick end, and run its tip down the large holes of the grater. Continue this downward shredding motion until about 2 inches of the carrot remain intact. Stop here to avoid cutting your fingers on the holes of the box grater.
Repeat with the remaining carrots.
Combine the almonds and water in a blender and blend for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until creamy.
Place a nut milk bag over a large bowl and strain the milk, squeezing out as much liquid as you can.
Add the maple syrup and vanilla, if desired.
Bring a medium pot of water to boil and place a bowl of ice water nearby. Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water for 30 seconds, and then use a slotted spoon to scoop it into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and pat dry.
Place the broccoli into a food processor with the basil, olive oil, cheese, lemon juice and zest, garlic, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper. Pulse until combined.
If desired, toss the pesto with the cooked pasta. Serve with pine nuts, red pepper flakes, and additional cheese. Season to taste and serve.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the leeks, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, until softened.
Add the garlic, stir, and cook for 2 more minutes. Stir in the white wine vinegar and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds, and then add the broth, potatoes, and white beans. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
Let cool slightly, then transfer the soup to a blender with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the lemon juice, and the mustard. Blend until smooth. Work in batches if necessary. Season to taste and serve with chopped parsley, pine nuts, red pepper flakes, and drizzles of additional olive oil, if desired.
Finely chop ¼ of the cucumber and reserve for garnish.
Peel the remaining cucumber, cut into chunks, and transfer to a blender. Add the tomatoes, peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Season to taste and chill for at least 2 hours.
Serve the soup with the reserved diced cucumber, fresh herbs, drizzles of olive oil, and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the carrots, onion, celery, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes.
Add the vinegar, stir, and then add the tomatoes, broth, beans, garlic, potatoes, cabbage and thyme. Cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes and cabbage are tender.
Season to taste, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve.
Place the beans in a large bowl. Sort through them and discard any stones or debris. Cover with 2 to 3 inches of water and discard any beans that float. Soak at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse well.
Place the beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Skim any foam off the top, then add the shallots, garlic, fennel, salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, and the kombu, if using. Continue simmering until tender, up to 2 more hours, stirring occasionally. The timing will depend on the type and freshness of your beans (older beans will take longer than fresher beans). I typically check them every 30 minutes. Add more water to the pot, as needed, as it starts to evaporate.
When the beans are tender, remove the garlic, fennel stalks, and kombu. Discard the garlic papers. Use the back of a knife to mash the soft garlic cloves into a paste, then return it to the pot. Stir in the olive oil and lemon juice, and season to taste. I like to add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon more salt, more pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.
Add the chard leaves and cook until the chard is just wilted. Season to taste and serve in bowls with drizzles of olive oil and crusty bread. Sprinkle with parsley.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Cut the meat with the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices and season on both sides with the salt and pepper. Place the flour into a pie pan. Dredge the pieces of meat on both sides in the flour mixture. Tenderize the meat using a needling device, until each slice is 1/4-inch thick. Dredge the slices on both sides once more and set aside.
Add enough of the bacon drippings or vegetable oil to just cover the bottom of a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the steaks to the pan, being careful not to overcrowd. Cook until golden brown on both sides, approximately 2 minutes per side. Remove the steaks to a plate and repeat until all of the steaks have been browned.
Remove the last steaks from the pot and add the onions, garlic, and celery. Saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine. Next add the tomatoes, paprika, oregano, Worcestershire sauce and beef broth and stir to combine. Return the meat to the pot, submerging it in the liquid. Cover the pot and place it in the oven on the middle rack. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the meat is tender and falling apart.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup, salsa, water and tortillas in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir the beef mixture. Top with the cheese.
Creamy Mexican Fiesta: Stir in 1/2 cup sour cream with the soup.
Ranchero Style: Use corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of Cheddar.
Serving Suggestion: Serve with a mixed green salad with Italian salad dressing and corn-on-the cob. For dessert serve with a store bought flan.
Cost per recipe: $7.59
Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in the pan or griddle over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Cook the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.
Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover, or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese.
Place the burgers on the bun bottoms and, if desired, top with tomato, lettuce, onion, and a dollop of horseradish mustard mayonnaise. Pile on the potato chips, top with the bun tops, and serve immediately.
Horseradish Mustard Mayonnaise:
Yield:
1/2 cup
Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, and horseradish in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. The sauce can be prepared 1 day in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator.
Preheat a grill.
Grill the sausage on both sides until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes per side. Brush onions and peppers with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the onions and peppers until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the sausage from the grill and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. Remove the onions, separate into rings, and roughly chop. Remove the peppers and slice into 1/8-inch thick slices.
Heat grill to high. Brush dough with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Turn over and grill for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a flat surface.
Divide the fontina cheese among the 4 pizza rounds. Divide the sausage, onions and peppers over the cheese. Place the pizza on the grill, close the cover and grill until the cheese has melted, about 3 to 4 minutes. To finish in the oven, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the pizza on sheet pans and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix together the ricotta, extra-virgin olive oil, and oregano in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the pizzas from the oven and drizzle with Basil Vinaigrette. Top with dollops of the ricotta cheese mixture and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve.
Basil Vinaigrette:
Combine all ingredients and blend until smooth. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.
For the glaze:
Bring vinegar to a boil in a small nonreactive saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup. Stir in the honey and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
For the steak:
Heat grill to high. Brush steak on both sides with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides and cooked to medium-rare doneness, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the grill to a cutting board, tent lightly with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice into 1/4-inch thick slices.
For the pizza:
Heat the grill to high.
Brush both sides of the pizzas with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the grill, divide the Monterey Jack cheese over the top of each one and then sprinkle with the blue cheese. Place back on the grill, close the cover of the grill and grill until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute. Remove to a flat surface, divide the steak between each pizza, then top with the watercress Drizzle with some of the balsamic glaze and sprinkle with some of the shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Pizza Dough:
In a large bowl stir together 1/3 cup water, yeast, and sugar and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/3 cup water, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 3/4 cups flour, cornmeal, and salt and blend until the mixture forms a dough. Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour, as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth about 5 to 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball.
Lightly oil the sides and bottom of a large bowl with oil, add the dough, turn to coat in the oil, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Gently punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle that is 1/8-inch thick. Brush off excess flour and transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cover each circle of dough with plastic wrap and continue stacking rolled out pieces on top of each other. Wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill.
If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 1 hour to retard charring.

Puree balsamic basting vinaigrette ingredients in a blender for 30 seconds.
Place meats, shrimp, and veggies in individual bowls and set out buffet style. Instruct your guests to skewer their own kabobs and baste veggies with balsamic vinaigrette.
Grill kabobs directly over heat source for about 10 to 15 minutes, turning 1/4 rotation every 2 to 3 minutes, or until the meat and/or fish is cooked throughout.
In a large nonstick skillet cook the meat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate. Drain any fat remaining in the skillet.
Heat the oil in the skillet over a medium heat. Add the onions and carrots and cook, covered, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Raise the heat to moderately-high. Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are soft and their liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes longer. Return the meat to the pan. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in the broth, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and bring to a simmer being sure to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the peas.

Place the rice in a medium saucepan with 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook 12 more minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, until ready to serve. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour out all but about 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings from the pan and increase the heat to medium high. Add the broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, until charred in spots. Add 3/4 cup water and simmer until the broccoli is crisp-tender and only a few tablespoons of water remain, about 3 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. Divide the rice and broccoli among bowls and drizzle with the pan juices. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet, season with salt and fry as desired. Place an egg in each bowl and top with the bacon, cilantro, scallions and pickled jalapenos.
Prepare the kebabs: Whisk the olive oil, vinegar, paprika, cumin, brown sugar, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Cut the beef into 1 1/2-inch pieces, add to the bowl and toss with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Meanwhile, make the salsa: Mix the tomato, bell pepper, onion, olive oil, cilantro, vinegar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a bowl. Make the chimichurri: Puree the parsley, cilantro, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a blender. Transfer to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate the salsa and chimichurri until serving.
Preheat a grill to high. Thread the beef and sausage onto skewers (keep the meats separate), leaving a bit of space between each piece. Brush the kebabs with olive oil.
Brush the grill with olive oil. Grill the kebabs, turning, until charred and cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes for the beef and 10 to 12 minutes for the sausage. Transfer to a platter and let rest 5 minutes. Season with salt and serve with the salsa and chimichurri.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, thyme, sage, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring to incorporate. Stir in the Worcestershire. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
Add the panko to a large mixing bowl and pour over the chicken broth so the breadcrumbs soak up the liquid. Add the turkey, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the cooled onion mixture and mix well with your hands until well combined. Form the mixture into a 10-by-5-inch loaf on the foil-lined baking sheet. Coat the top and sides with the ketchup.
Put the meatloaf in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until a thermometer inserted in the center of the loaf reads 165 degrees F, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.
Whisk the vinegar, lemon juice, oregano and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a large bowl; slowly whisk in the olive oil until smooth.
Add the cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce, olives, caperberries, Peppadews and red onion to the bowl with the dressing and toss. Season with salt and pepper.
Add the garlic, jalapenos, lime juice, orange juice, cilantro, olive oil, sugar, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper to a food processor and puree until very smooth.
Cut the steak crosswise into thirds (skirt steak is typically long and skinny, so this will make the pieces more manageable when grilling). Place in a large resealable plastic bag, then pour in the marinade, flipping and massaging the steak to make sure it’s evenly coated. Remove as much air as possible, then seal the bag and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours (any longer and the citrus juice will start to "cook" the steak).
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat and brush the hot grates with oil. Remove the steak from the marinade, letting excess drip off, and season both sides with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Grill until nicely charred on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board to rest, about 10 minutes. Thinly slice the steak against the grain, then serve with lime wedges.
Position an oven rack in the uppermost part of the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the bacon. Cook, stirring often, until crispy and golden, about 8 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings from the skillet and return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened but not brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the green beans, corn, zucchini, 3/4 cup of the tomato sauce and 1/2 cup water. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the zucchini and green beans are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the basil and tomato and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Meanwhile, add the remaining tomato sauce to a medium ovenproof skillet and add the salmon skin-side up, making sure the fillets don't touch. Lightly brush the skins with oil and bake on the top oven rack until the sauce starts to bubble around the sides and the salmon is opaque on the outside but still rare on the inside, about 6 minutes. Turn the oven to broil and broil until the skin is crispy and blistered in places, 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler.
Before serving, drizzle the salmon with oil and sprinkle the bacon over the succotash. Serve with crusty bread.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.
Place a grill basket on a baking sheet. Mix together the cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl. Add the steak to a large bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle a third of the spice blend on the steak and toss until coated. Transfer the steak to one side of the grill basket. Repeat the process first with the peppers and onion, placing them in the middle of the grill basket, and then with the chicken, arranging it on the remaining empty side of the grill basket; try to keep the rows mostly separate (they can overlap slightly). Close and secure the grill basket.
Put the grill basket on the grill and let cook, flipping once, until everything starts to brown and caramelize, and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the grill, place on a clean baking sheet and open the basket, letting it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grill the tortillas until they start to char slightly, about 30 seconds per side.
Divide the meats and vegetables among the tortillas. Serve with desired toppings.
Preheat a grill to medium. Microwave the potatoes until softened but not fully cooked, about 5 minutes. Let cool a few minutes, then dice.
Put 4 tablespoons butter in a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted. Add the potatoes, corn, garlic and Old Bay and toss well; season lightly with salt and pepper.
Tear off four 18-inch-long sheets of foil. Divide the vegetables among the foil sheets, piling them in the middle. Add the shrimp to the same bowl. Sprinkle with the lemon zest and a pinch of salt and pepper; toss well. Add the shrimp to the vegetable piles.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons wine over each pile of vegetables and shrimp. Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into 4 pieces and add a piece to each pile. Bring the short ends of the foil together and fold twice; fold in the sides to form a packet.
Grill the foil packets until the potatoes are tender and the shrimp is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the grill and let stand 5 minutes. Carefully open the packets and sprinkle with the parsley; serve with the lemon wedges.
Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat. For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer's guide for best results.)
Cut three 12-inch pieces of heavy-duty foil. Working one piece at a time, fold in half lengthwise. Fold in half again and fold in half one more time; you should have a long strip of foil about 1 1/2 inches wide. Twist the two ends of the strip in opposite directions making a twisted rope of foil. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of foil. Set all three ropes in the center of a small disposable aluminum roaster about 1 inch apart and place the ham on top. (The ropes will prevent the bottom of the ham from burning.) Cover tightly with foil and place over indirect heat (if your grill has a thermometer, it should be at around 325 degrees F). Cover the grill and cook until just warmed through, 35 to 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil the pineapple juice, brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until the glaze is very thick and has the consistency of honey, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and remove from the heat.
Carefully remove the foil cover from the ham and discard; baste with the glaze, making sure to get in between each slice. Increase the heat to medium-high and move the ham over direct heat. Cover the grill and cook until the glaze begins to bubble, about 5 minutes. Baste again with the remaining glaze, then cover and cook until the glaze bubbles, 5 minutes more. Continue basting and cooking until the ham is shiny and the glaze begins to brown, about 10 more minutes. Remove from the grill and let sit 10 minutes, uncovered, before serving.
Meanwhile, grill the pineapple rings over direct heat until charred on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool. Arrange the pineapple rings on the uncut portion of the ham, grill marks facing up, and use toothpicks to secure them in place. Place a cherry in the center of each ring and secure with a toothpick.
Serve the ham with any accumulated juices, remaining pineapple rings and cherries on the side.
Quarter the zucchini lengthwise, then thinly slice with a knife or mandoline. Transfer to a colander set over a bowl and toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Let drain 15 minutes.
Combine the zucchini, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, lime juice and half of the cilantro in a bowl. Set aside 1 hour.
Preheat a grill to medium high. Mix the cumin and coriander in a small bowl. Brush the fish all over with olive oil, then rub with the spice mixture and season generously with salt and pepper. Grill the fish until it is well marked and releases easily from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip the fish and continue cooking until firm, 2 to 4 more minutes, depending on the thickness. Transfer to a platter.
Stir the remaining cilantro into the zucchini mixture and season with salt. Spoon over the fish.
Preheat a grill to medium high and prepare for indirect grilling: On a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side. On a gas grill, turn off half the burners. Toss the chicken with the ginger, 1 tablespoon fish sauce and 1 teaspoon each brown sugar, lime zest, lime juice and chili-garlic sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken skin-side up on the cooler side of the grill; cover and cook until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Move to direct heat and cook, uncovered, flipping occasionally, until the skin is charred and crisp, about 5 more minutes.
Meanwhile, make the dressing: Whisk 2 tablespoons water and the remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 2 teaspoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 2 teaspoons lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce in a large bowl. Whisk in the vegetable oil.
Add the nectarines, mint, peanuts and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the bowl with the dressing; toss. Divide the chicken and nectarine salad among plates.
Combine the vinegar, sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt and the ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Let cool.
Transfer half of the vinegar mixture to a large bowl and add the carrots and daikon; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Transfer the remaining vinegar mixture to a shallow baking dish; stir in the lemongrass, shallot, soy sauce and fish sauce. Add the chicken thighs and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, flipping the chicken halfway through.
Preheat a grill to medium high and brush the grates with vegetable oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade, scraping off the lemongrass and shallot; season with salt. Grill the chicken until well marked and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board.
Drain the carrots and daikon; stir in the cilantro. Cut the chicken thighs in half. Toast the bread on the grill and spread the mayonnaise on both sides; sandwich with the sliced cucumber, chicken, carrot mixture and jalapeno. Serve with Sriracha.
For the chicken fingers: Combine the cereal, melba toast, Parmesan, parsley if using, paprika and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large resealable bag and, using the bottom of a skillet or rolling pin, crush into a coarse meal. Dump out into a shallow dish. Whisk the egg whites with 2 tablespoons water in another shallow dish.
Dip the chicken tenders into the egg white, shake off the excess, and coat thoroughly in the coating. Bake immediately, or refrigerate up to 1 hour before baking. To freeze, arrange the breaded chicken tenders on a baking sheet and freeze until hard, 1 to 2 hours. Store in resealable freezer bags for up to 1 month.
For the sauce: Combine the yogurt, basil, red pepper, 1 tablespoon water, vinegar, garlic and salt to taste in a small bowl; stir together. Wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Fit a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack and spray with cooking spray. Generously spray the fresh or frozen chicken tenders all over with cooking spray. Arrange on the prepared rack and bake, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes (if frozen, 20 to 25 minutes). Remove from the oven and season with salt. Serve with the dipping sauce.
Let the tenderloin stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.
Prepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat.
Put the wine in a medium bowl. Soak a large clean cotton towel in the wine until completely soaked. Wring out the towel until it is damp but not dripping. Lay the towel out flat on a work surface with a long side facing you. Sprinkle the salt on the towel to make a 16-by-12-inch rectangle that is about 1/4 inch thick. Scatter the red pepper flakes, black pepper and oregano sprigs on the salt.
Position the tenderloin on the bottom center of the salt rectangle, so there is about a 1-inch border of salt on the bottom edge. Roll up the tenderloin in the towel, folding in the sides and making sure the meat is covered in salt on all sides. Tie the towel tightly with kitchen twine at 1- to 2-inch intervals.
Place the wrapped tenderloin directly on the coals for 10 minutes, then flip and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove to a metal baking sheet and let rest for 5 minutes, then cut the tenderloin out of the towel and break away the salt crust. Transfer to a cutting board. Let rest for another 10 minutes before slicing.
For the meat: Mix garlic, rosemary, balsamic vinegar, wine, olive oil, and black pepper to taste in a self-sealing plastic bag or a shallow dish. Add the meat, turning to coat, and cover or seal. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
Prepare an outdoor grill with a hot fire for indirect grilling.
For the marmalade: On a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil (or a doubled piece of regular), toss the onions with the rest of the marmalade ingredients. Bring edges of foil up and crimp closed. Place package on the edge of the grill (over medium-high heat). Cook, turning the sealed package every now and then so the onions cook evenly until meltingly tender, about 45 minutes.
Remove the meat from the marinade, pat it dry, and season generously with salt and black pepper to taste. Lightly oil the grill and sear the meat over high heat for 5 minutes. Then rotate it (don't turn it over yet) about 45 degrees from its original spot on the grill. Once you've made your grill mark, flip and repeat on the other side. Move the steak to the cooler side of the grill, cover with an aluminum pan, and cook, rotating (not flipping) periodically, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 125 degree sF, about 15 to 20 minutes. Let steak rest on a cutting board about 10 minutes.
For the toast: Meanwhile, sprinkle garlic cloves with salt. With the flat side of a large knife, mash and smear garlic mixture into a paste. Mix with the butter. Lightly oil the grill, place bread over direct heat, and toast on both sides until golden brown, about 2 minutes total. Remove bread from grill and spread generously with the garlic butter. Thinly slice steak against the grain on an angle. Top toasts with onion marmalade, arugula, and sliced meat. Serve open-faced with mustard and/or horseradish.
For the flank steak: Prepare an outdoor grill for cooking over direct and indirect heat (if your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling).
Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is hot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring and finely crumbling with a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and let cool.
Set the flank steak on a cutting board. Use a knife to score the steak down the middle against the grain, halfway through its thickness. Working from the center line, out toward the edges, cut thin flaps from the score to the edge, like a gatefold. Pound with the flat side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt and pepper and brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Chop the cilantro, parsley, olives, pickled jalapenos and garlic together on a cutting board to make a chunky paste. Brush the steak with the mustard. Spread the herb paste over the steak, leaving empty a 1-inch border around the edges. Pat to adhere the paste to the meat. Starting a third of the way in from the right, make 4 equidistant lines of egg. Between the egg lines, mound lines of chorizo, then carrots and then peppers, covering all but that first third of the steak's surface. Roll the steak around the fillings like a jelly roll, from the filled to the empty side. Tie closed at 2-inch intervals around the circumference with kitchen twine. Tie 1 more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat.
Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the steak on the direct-heat side of the grill to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to the indirect-heat side of the grill, cover and cook, turning occasionally and testing the temperature frequently, until the very center reads 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, for a steak that is well-done on the outside and medium-rare in the center, 25 to 30 minutes more. Transfer the matambre to a cutting board to rest.
For the chimichurri sauce: Finely chop the cilantro, parsley and garlic on a cutting board. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the red pepper flakes, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the olive oil.
Untie and slice the flank steak into 6-thick slices on a slight bias. Serve with the chimichurri sauce for drizzling.
Prepare the steaks: Pulse the coriander seeds, peppercorns and mustard seeds in a spice grinder until coarsely ground. Transfer to a small bowl and add the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder and allspice; mix until evenly combined. Season the steaks all over with salt and pepper, then rub with the vegetable oil. Rub the steaks on both sides with the spice mixture, pressing to adhere. Let sit at room temperature, 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat a grill to medium high. Lightly oil the grates.
Make the mustard butter: Stir the butter in a small bowl until smooth. Mix in the mustard, parsley, chives, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.
Grill the steaks until well marked, 4 to 5 minutes. Rotate the steaks 90 degrees, moving them around as needed to prevent flare-ups, and cook until crosshatch grill marks form, 4 to 5 more minutes. Flip the steaks and cook 4 to 5 minutes, then rotate 90 degrees and cook 4 to 5 more minutes, or until a thermometer inserted sideways into the center of the steaks registers 125 degrees F for medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes. Serve with the mustard butter.
For the filling: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Stir together the sugar, flour and nutmeg in a medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup water and the lemon juice to make a smooth mixture. Add the fruit and toss gently to coat evenly.
Put the saucepan on the stovetop over medium-low heat and stir the fruit mixture gently until it simmers. Reduce the heat to low and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a shallow 2-quart baking or gratin dish and dot with the butter. Set aside.
For the biscuits: Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Work in the butter with your fingertips until the texture resembles coarse meal. Add the milk, vanilla and lemon zest to the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened to make a wet, slightly lumpy dough. Do not over mix.
Drop large spoonfuls of dough onto the top of the peaches, randomly spacing mounds of dough and leaving some uncovered areas to give a "cobbled" look. Spread the dough to an even thickness and sprinkle dough with sugar if desired.
Bake the cobbler until the biscuits are lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Let the cobbler set up at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Preheat a pellet grill to 275 degrees F (see Cook's Note). Combine 2 tablespoons salt, 4 tablespoons coarsely ground pepper and 2 teaspoons paprika in a small bowl. Rub each rack of ribs all over with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle evenly with the salt and spice mixture on both sides.
Transfer the ribs, meat-side up, to the grill grates. Cover the grill and cook for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup cider vinegar with 1/3 cup water in a spray bottle. After 1 hour spray the ribs with the vinegar-water mixture so they are damp all over. Cover and cook for 1 more hour.
Meanwhile, combine the ketchup, 3/4 cup water, the remaining 1/3 cup cider vinegar, white vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, hot sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons paprika in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is warmed through and the sugar is melted, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
Check the ribs and spray them again with vinegar-water. They should be starting to take on a red color from the smoke. Cover and cook until they are deep red, 30 to 45 minutes. Spray the ribs once more, then brush the meaty part of each rack with 1/4 cup of the sauce. Close the grill and cook for another 15 minutes so the sauce can set.
Lay down two pieces of heavy-duty foil that are long enough to enclose each rack on a work surface and spread half of each sheet with 1/4 cup sauce. Transfer the rib racks, meat side down, onto the saucy part of the foil. Coat the bone sides with 1/4 cup sauce and a few sprays of the vinegar-water, then fold the foil over and seal tightly.
Add another layer of foil if the first has punctured during wrapping. Transfer the ribs to a rimmed baking sheet and place on the grill (the baking sheet will catch any juices that leak out). Cover and cook until tender but not falling off the bone, about 2 hours.
Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before carefully unwrapping (watch out for hot steam). Slice each rack into individual rib portions and serve with the remaining sauce.
For the pastry crust: Pulse the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and pulse until the flour looks like cornmeal. Sprinkle in 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough with your fingers; if it doesn't hold together, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse again.
Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disc. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and preferably overnight.
Lightly flour a work surface, then roll the dough into an 11-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom, with an even overhang of dough all around. Press the dough into the edges of the pan and the fluted sides. Roll the rolling pin over the top to cut off the extra dough (discard the extra). Poke the bottom and sides all over with a fork. Chill until completely cold, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.
Press a piece of parchment over the chilled crust, then fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Put the pan on a baking sheet. Bake until the crust is set and golden around the edges, about 40 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and weights. Return to the oven and bake until the crust is dry and slightly golden, about 15 minutes more. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
For the filling: Combine the butter, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup water in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are completely softened and all the water has evaporated, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a separate medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring, until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
When the onions have cooked for 30 minutes, add the bacon using a slotted spoon, then stir in 1 teaspoon of the thyme and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread the onion mixture in the bottom of the crust and sprinkle with the Gruyere. Whisk together the cream, eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined. Pour the cream mixture over the filling in the crust and top with the remaining 1 teaspoon thyme.
Bake the quiche on the baking sheet until set and golden, about 30 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.
Make the quinoa: Bring the quinoa and 2 1/2 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until the quinoa is tender (the little tails will pop out) and most of the water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes Drain off any excess water. Stir in the chopped cilantro, scallions, oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Serve warm or at room temperature. (The quinoa can be cooked, cooled and refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days. Microwave just enough to take the chill off, about 2 minutes, stirring about halfway through.)
Make the avocado cream: While the quinoa cooks, process or blend the avocado, sour cream, Parmesan, lime juice, 1 tablespoon water, cayenne and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender until smooth and creamy.
If the corn still has a chill, microwave it for about 1 minute.
Build the bowls: Divide the quinoa evenly among 4 bowls. Top each with neat piles and/or rows of chicken, tortilla chips, corn, salsa and pepitas. Top with some sauce, a sprig of cilantro and a lime quarter.
Preheat the oven to 525˚ (or the highest temperature available). Press and stretch the pizza dough into a 12- to 13-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Lightly dust the top with flour and cover with a clean kitchen towel.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes and oregano. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the beef and season with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, breaking up the beef with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin and garlic powder and cook, stirring, until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the beef mixture to a small bowl with a slotted spoon.
Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly sprinkle the skillet with flour and immediately add the pizza dough, stretching it as needed to completely cover the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the dough starts to puff slightly, about 2 minutes. Spoon the tomato sauce mixture all over the dough and spoon the beef mixture on top. Sprinkle with the cheddar, top with the red onion, then sprinkle with the mozzarella. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the crust is browned around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Run a small spatula around the edges of the pizza to loosen. Top with lettuce, avocado and pico de gallo. Cut into wedges.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in the rice, cover and boil until tender, about 18 minutes; drain well and keep warm.
Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Toss the green beans, 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil and the sugar on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil, stirring once, until the beans are tender and charred, about 8 minutes.
Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the turkey and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, 3 minutes. Add the garlic, pickle and chile paste and cook until the garlic is slightly golden, about 3 minutes.
Whisk the chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and cornstarch in a bowl. Add the green beans to the skillet with the turkey mixture and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Serve with the rice.
Preheat the broiler. Fill a wide pot with 3 inches of salted water and bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until al dente, about 11 minutes, then drain, transfer to a cutting board and halve crosswise.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground meat and cook, stirring, until browned. Add the tomato sauce and red pepper flakes and simmer 5 minutes. Add the spinach and stir until it wilts, then add the ricotta and bring to a low simmer. Season with salt and remove from the heat. Toss the mozzarella and 4 tablespoons parmesan in a bowl.
Cover the bottom of an 8-inch-square flameproof baking dish with a layer of slightly overlapping lasagna noodles. Top with half of the meat sauce and half of the cheese mixture. Repeat with another layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce and cheese mixture. Cover with the remaining noodles and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons parmesan. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and broil until golden and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes. Top with the basil.
For the chicken: Mix together the buttermilk, pickle juice, Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons of the paprika, 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, making sure the pieces are submerged. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.
Mix together the flour, cornstarch, remaining 1 teaspoon paprika, remaining 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a large bowl until well combined; set aside.
Fill a deep heavy pot with 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F.
Remove a chicken piece from the buttermilk mixture, letting the excess drip off, and roll it in the seasoned flour until completely coated. Push it to the side in the bowl and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
Working in 2 batches, carefully lower the chicken into the oil. The temperature will drop to 300 to 325 degrees F; adjust the heat to maintain this temperature so the crust doesn't burn before the meat is cooked. Fry, undisturbed, 2 to 3 minutes to set the crust, then carefully lift with tongs to check the browning. It should be light golden; if it is browning too quickly, lower the heat slightly. Continue to fry, turning as needed, until golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 14 more minutes for smaller pieces and 14 to 16 more minutes for larger ones. (A thermometer should register 160 degrees F in the breasts and 165 degrees F in the thighs and drumsticks.)
Remove the chicken to a rack to drain and let rest a few minutes. Season with salt. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
For the coleslaw: Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and celery salt in a medium bowl. Add the coleslaw mix and toss to coat. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as needed before serving.
Serve the chicken hot or at room temperature with the coleslaw, potato rolls and pickles on the side.
Preheat a grill for cooking at medium heat and lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the corn and chiles, turning every few minutes, until the corn is tender and browned in spots and the chiles are nicely charred, about 8 minutes for the corn and about 4 minutes for the chiles. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool slightly.
When they are cool enough to handle, stem and deseed the chiles (keep some of the seeds if you prefer a spicier dish). Finely chop the chiles and transfer to a medium bowl. Using a sharp chef’s knife, cut the kernels off the corn cobs. Using the back of the knife, scrape along the cobs to release the starchy, milky liquid and any remaining kernels. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half the kernels to the same bowl as the chiles and set aside; keep the remaining half of the kernels and the corn “milk” separate. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, a pinch of salt and a couple grinds of pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, turmeric and coriander and cook until the garlic is tender and the spices are lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in the reserved corn kernels and corn “milk” and cook until warmed through. Stir in the broth, half-and-half and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, bring the mixture to a simmer and then remove from the heat.
Use an immersion blender to puree the corn mixture into a very smooth and creamy sauce. Alternatively, transfer to a blender and blend on high speed until very smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep the corn sauce warm in the saucepan over low heat.
When the water boils, salt it and cook the gnocchi according to the package directions. Drain well. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place half the gnocchi in the skillet and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the gnocchi and continue to cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.
Just before serving, stir the basil, parsley, vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon oil into the reserved corn and chile mixture until combined. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Spoon the corn sauce into 4 shallow dinner bowls and place the crispy gnocchi on top. Garnish with the corn and chile salad.
Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For a gas grill (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For a charcoal grill, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer's guide for best results.)
Slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple with a sharp knife and set the pieces aside. Remove the peel from the pineapple, cutting it off in strips. Using a paring knife, carefully hollow out the pineapple to a 3/4-inch-thick shell.
Stuff the pineapple with the ribs. Place the top and bottom pieces back on the pineapple and secure them in place with 4 long bamboo skewers.
Place a large piece of parchment on your work surface. Arrange 6 slices bacon horizontally on the parchment. The edges of the slices should touch but not overlap. Working with the remaining 6 slices, weave the bacon in an over-under pattern by lifting alternating slices of the horizontal bacon and vertically placing a slice of bacon over or under as needed to create a woven lattice design. Wrap the bacon lattice around the pineapple and secure it in place with 8 long bamboo skewers. Trim the protruding skewer tips down to 1/2 inch lengths with kitchen shears.
Put the swineapple on the grill over the drip pan with the bacon seam-side down. Cover the grill and cook until the bacon is crispy and golden brown and the meat is hot in the center, about 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board. Remove the skewers and slice the pineapple into rings for serving.
Place a pizza stone or upside-down baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured work surface into an 11-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-covered pizza peel or another upside-down baking sheet. Brush the dough with olive oil, then spread the refried beans on top, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spoon the salsa over the beans and sprinkle with the cheese. Scatter the scallions and jalapenos on top. Slide the pizza and parchment onto the hot stone and bake until the crust is crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes.
While the pizza is baking, combine the sour cream, half of the lime juice and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. In another bowl, toss the lettuce, tomato, and lime juice to taste; season with salt.
Top the pizza with the salad, then drizzle with the sour cream mixture and sprinkle with the cilantro. Cut into slices.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Mix the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl. Mix the panko with the parsley, butter, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper in another small bowl.
Place the salmon skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet and spread the surface with the Dijon. Press the brown sugar mixture all over the salmon then top with the breadcrumb mixture. Crimp all four sides of the foil to create a border around the salmon, this will help collect the juices so they don't spread and burn. Bake until the breadcrumbs are golden brown, and the salmon is firm and flakes easily when pressed, 15 to 18 minutes. Cut into four equal portions for serving.
Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 275 degrees F. Tie the parsley, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves together with kitchen twine.
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook the beef in a single layer spaced about an inch apart, turning a few times, until the pieces are browned on at least three sides, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. As the beef finishes browning, transfer to a large plate.
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the carrots and celery and continue to cook until they are brightly colored and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Stir in the wine, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, and cook until it evaporates, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle the vegetables with the flour, stir to evenly coat them and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth, potatoes, tomatoes and the reserved beef with any accumulated juices. Season with 3 tablespoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the herb bundle and bring the stew to a simmer.
Cover the pot and then transfer to the oven. Bake until the beef is tender but still holds its shape, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let the stew cool for 30 minutes before serving. Discard the herb bundle and serve topped with chopped parsley.
Whisk together 2 1/2 cups of the flour and the baking powder in a medium bowl until completely combined. Toss 1 1/2 cups of the blueberries with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour in a medium bowl until completely coated. Whisk together the buttermilk, sour cream, vanilla and salt in a large measuring cup until smooth.
Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Spray the top of a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray and line with standard cupcake liners. (It's important to spray the top of the pan because the muffin tops will stick to the pan if you don't.)
Beat the butter, granulated sugar and lemon zest with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, occasionally scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg and yolks and continue beating until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes.
With the mixer on low, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the wet ingredients in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Fold in the blueberries until evenly distributed (be careful not to overmix).
Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups with a heaping 1/3 cup per muffin. Top the batter with the remaining 1/2 cup blueberries, gently pressing to adhere (you should have 4 to 5 berries per muffin). Sprinkle with the raw sugar.
Bake the muffins, rotating the pan halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove the muffins onto the wire rack to cool completely.
Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.
Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.
Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Use a 1-ounce ice cream scoop to scoop half the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Chill the remaining dough while you bake the first batch.
Bake at 375 degrees until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Cool the baking sheets completely, then line with parchment paper and repeat the scooping and baking process with the remaining dough.
For the shortcakes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk the heavy cream, sour cream and vanilla in a small bowl; refrigerate until ready to use. Pulse the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter; pulse until the mixture looks like fine meal. Pour in the chilled heavy cream mixture and pulse until just combined.
Lightly flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Pat out the dough 1/2-inch thick. Cut out as many biscuits as you can with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Then pat the remaining dough out to 1/2-inch thick again. Cut more biscuits; you should get 12.
Put 6 of the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops generously with cream, then top each cream-brushed biscuit with one of the remaining biscuit rounds. (This makes it easier to split once they are baked.) Brush the top of each biscuit stack with more heavy cream and sprinkle 1 teaspoon granulated sugar on each biscuit.
Bake the biscuits until golden and puffed, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.
Meanwhile, for the topping: Toss the strawberries and 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar in a medium bowl.
Just before serving, beat the heavy cream, sour cream, the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.
Split the shortcakes in half. Spoon half the cream on the bottom of the biscuits, top evenly with the strawberries and top with the remaining cream. Put each biscuit top on and serve.
Place the bread cubes in a small bowl and add enough water to cover. Let soak until the bread is completely saturated, about 2 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry.
Combine the bread, tomatoes, roughly chopped cucumber, bell pepper, garlic, 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, coriander, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a blender. (Work in two batches if necessary.) Blend on high speed until creamy and very smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl or 8-cup liquid measuring cup. Cover and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
Season to taste with more salt and pepper and add up to 1 more tablespoon vinegar. Ladle into serving bowls, top with the finely diced cucumber and drizzle with more olive oil. Serve chilled.
Sprinkle the roast with 3 tablespoons of the salt, rubbing into the grain and covering all sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.
Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 275 degrees F.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Cook the meat, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Reduce the heat to medium-high and heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil in the pot. Cook the onions and the remaining 1 tablespoon salt, stirring occasionally, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes (it's ok if the onion wedges break apart). Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the paste is brick red and the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and bay leaves and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pot, until slightly reduced and you can no longer smell the alcohol, about 4 minutes. Add the flour, stir to coat the onions and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the broth and pepper and bring to a boil.
Nestle the meat and any accumulated juices into the onions. Arrange the carrots, celery and potatoes around the roast, pushing them into the onions and surrounding the beef. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender but still holds its shape and is not falling apart, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Let rest, covered, at least 45 minutes before serving.
Transfer the roast to a cutting board and remove the twine with scissors, if necessary. Slice against the grain.
Divide the vegetables among plates and arrange the sliced beef over top. Spoon sauce over the top garnish with parsley and chives.
If your peppers don't sit upright on your cutting board, trim about 1/8-inch off the bottoms to even them out so they can stand without falling over. Cut the top off each pepper about 1/2-inch down. Remove and discard the stems, then finely chop the remaining flesh from the tops. Scoop out the seeds and as much of the membranes as you can. Place the peppers in a large microwave-safe bowl with 1/2 cup water. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high power for 12 minutes. Carefully uncover and let them sit until ready to assemble.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spread the beef in an even layer and cook undisturbed until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, breaking up any clumps with the back of a spoon and scraping up any browned bits from the pan until the meat is lightly browned all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the browned meat to a large bowl with a slotted spoon.
Reduce the heat to medium. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add the reserved chopped peppers, onions, garlic, thyme, 4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but not browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until falling apart and much of the liquid has evaporated, about 7 minutes.
Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly until brick red colored, about 1 minute. Stir in the wine and cook until the mixture is reduced, very thick and no smell of alcohol remains, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil. Transfer to the bowl with the beef. Stir in the rice until completely combined. (The mixture will be wet.) Season with salt and pepper.
Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.
Place the peppers cut-side up in a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Spoon the filling into the peppers, gently pressing it in with the back of a spoon. Be careful not to overstuff and split the sides of the peppers. Bake for 15 minutes. Then top with the cheese and continue baking until the filling is heated through and the cheese is browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tortellini and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Meanwhile, heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until slightly soft, about 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin and nutmeg and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in the cream and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to medium low; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cheese and cook until thick, about 1 more minute. Season with salt and pepper.
Add the tortellini to the skillet and toss with the sauce, adding some of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide among bowls and top with more cheese and parsley.
For each drink, muddle 2 watermelon chunks with the juice of 1 lime and 2 teaspoons sugar in a glass. Stir in a handful of mint leaves, then add 2 ounces white rum and ice to each glass. Top each drink with ginger ale and garnish with more mint.
For the BBQ sauce:
Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and stir until all the ingredients are incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, about 15 to 20 minutes.
For the chicken or steak:
Place a grill pan over medium heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Lightly coat with some of the BBQ sauce using a pastry brush. Place the meat on the grill. Place the remaining BBQ sauce, still in the small saucepan, over low heat or on the edge of a gas or charcoal grill and allow to gently simmer while the meat cooks.
Cook the chicken about 8 minutes per side. Cook the steaks starting at about 4 minutes per side until a meat thermometer reads the desired temperature, 120 degrees F for medium rare, 135 degrees F for medium (about 6 minutes per side), 155 degrees F for well done (about 9 minutes per side). Continually brush the meat with BBQ sauce every few minutes. Remove the meat from the grill and let rest for at least 5 minutes. Serve with the heated BBQ sauce alongside.
Alternately, the chicken can be baked in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the chicken skin side up in a baking dish and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and spoon the BBQ sauce all over the top of the chicken. Return the baking dish to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Bechamel sauce:
In a 2-quart pot, melt 5 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. When butter has completely melted, add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps from forming. Continue to simmer and whisk over medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon. Remove from heat and add the nutmeg and tomato sauce. Stir until well combined and check for seasoning. Set aside and allow to cool completely.
In a saute pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil. When almost smoking, add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper. Brown meat, breaking any large lumps, until it is no longer pink. Remove from heat and drain any excess fat. Set aside and allow to cool completely.
In a medium sized bowl, thoroughly mix the ricotta and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Into the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the bechamel sauce. Arrange the pasta sheets side by side, covering the bottom of the baking dish. Evenly spread a layer of all the ricotta mixture and then a layer of all the spinach. Arrange another layer of pasta sheets and spread all the ground beef on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on top of the beef. Spread another 1/3 of the bechamel sauce. Arrange the final layer of pasta sheets and top with remaining bechamel, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into 1/4-inch cubes and top lasagna.
Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place lasagna dish on top, cover and put on the middle rack of the oven and bake until top is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Remove cover and continue to bake for about 15 minutes.
Simple Tomato Sauce:
In a large casserole pot or Dutch over, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors.
Add 1/2 the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce.
If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months.
Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high.
For the sauce: Put the olive oil, butter, anchovy paste, garlic and olives in a small skillet. Warm over medium heat until the butter is melted and the sauce is gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the tomatoes and parsley.
For the fish: Sprinkle the halibut fillets on both sides with the salt and drizzle with the olive oil. Grill until grill-marked and opaque throughout, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer the fish to a serving platter and spoon the bagna cauda over the top.
In a food processor fitted with a metal blade add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cayenne, and salt. Pulse until combined. Pour in olive oil and pulse into a paste. Rub the paste on both sides of the lamb chops and let them marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator and allow the chops to come to room temperature; it will take about 20 minutes.
Heat a grill pan over high heat until almost smoking, add the chops and sear for about 2 minutes. Flip the chops over and cook for another 3 minutes for medium-rare and 3 1/2 minutes for medium.
In a medium bowl, combine the marinade ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine half the marinade with the chicken breasts, chicken thighs, and shrimp. Toss to combine. Cover and let marinate for at least 1 hour. If marinating for longer than 1 hour, make sure to refrigerate.
Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Brush the corn with reserved unused marinade and wrap in foil. Toss the mushrooms with 1/4 cup of the reserved unused marinade. Grill the chicken breasts and thighs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 7 minutes a side. Grill the corn inside the foil, for about 5 minutes a side. Grill the peppers for about 5 minutes a side. Grill the shrimp and the mushrooms, about 2 minutes a side. Brush the grilled peppers with the last of the reserved unused marinade. Slice the peppers and mushrooms before serving, if desired.
Arrange grilled meats and vegetables over the saffron orzo on a large platter and serve immediately.
Saffron Orzo:
Yield:
6 servings
In a large pot, bring the chicken stock to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, bringing the stock to a simmer. Add the saffron, stir, and allow the saffron to bloom, about 5 minutes. Return the heat to medium and the stock to a boil, then add the orzo and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain orzo and transfer to a large bowl. Add the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and parsley. Toss to combine.
Heat the oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, let it cook for 1 to 2 minutes and then add the herbs and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Cool to room temperature. Whisk in the lemon juice. Season the dressing with salt and pepper, to taste.
Prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat). Pat the scallops and squid dry with paper towels and thread them onto skewers. Brush them with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the scallops and squid until just cooked through, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Cool completely. Cut the squid crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide rings.
Combine the arugula, carrots, bell peppers, and cannellini beans in a large bowl. Toss with 1/2 cup of the dressing to coat.
Place 1 large or 2 medium radicchio leaves on each of 4 plates. Spoon the bean salad into the radicchio cups. Top with the scallops and squid. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the seafood and serve.
For the shrimp: Combine the orange zest and juice, chili paste, salt and olive oil in a medium bowl; mix well. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.
For the gremolata: Meanwhile, mix together the cocoa nibs, pistachios, parsley, orange zest, olive oil and salt in a small bowl.
To grill the shrimp: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
Thread the shrimp onto 12-inch bamboo skewers, 2 per skewer. Grill the shrimp until opaque all the way through, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the shrimp skewers to a platter, drizzle with the gremolata and serve.
For the pizza dough: Place the all-purpose flour, salt, sugar and yeast in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and water; once added, continue mixing for 1 minute.
Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until smooth.
Divide the dough into 3 even pieces and form into balls. Spray with cooking oil and then place in a large resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate overnight or up to 4 days for best flavor. (See Cook's Note.)
When ready to bake, transfer each dough ball to a lightly oiled bowl, cover and set aside until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Make the pizza pies: Preheat a gas grill to 500 degrees F or get a charcoal grill as hot as you can. Lightly dust a work surface with all-purpose flour.
For each pizza: Gently flatten a piece of dough with the palm of your hand and then roll it into a 10- to 11-inch round, about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Don't worry if it's not perfectly or even barely round; just make sure it's of uniform thickness (even if it's the shape of a beaver tail!).
Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour and transfer the stretched dough to the peel. (If you don't have a peel, use the back of an upturned sheet pan instead.) Slide the dough directly onto the grill. Cook until golden grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side; use tongs to flip.
For the white pizza: In a small bowl, mix together the ricotta and fontina cheeses along with the thyme, rosemary, honey and some salt and pepper. Brush a grilled crust with olive oil. Spread with the cheese mixture in an even layer. Use the peel to return the pizza to the grill. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is fully browned. Remove from the grill and top with the prosciutto and arugula.
For the margherita pizza: Brush a grilled crust with olive oil and spread evenly with the marinara sauce. Top with the torn mozzarella and sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Use the peel to transfer the pizza to the grill. Cover and cook until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Remove from grill and top with torn basil.
Apply Neely's Seasoning to each pork chop. Place pork chops in a large freezer safe plastic bag. Pour 2 cups of Neely's BBQ sauce into bag. Marinate in refrigerator for 8 hours.
Place pork chops on grill and cook until internal temperature is 160 degrees F. Reapply BBQ sauce to pork chops prior to serving.
Neely's Seasoning:
Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.
Neely's BBQ Sauce:
Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a large saucepan or Dutch oven.
Over high heat, bring ingredients to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.
Once sauce comes to a boil, reduce temperature to low and simmer, uncovered, for at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
In a mixing bowl, combine the drained whole tomatoes, olive oil, light brown sugar, carrots and shallots, and toss to coat. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper. Place the vegetables on a silicone or parchment-lined baking sheet and roast until caramelized, about 30 minutes.
Heat a soup pot over medium heat. Add the butter and cook until foaming. Add the crushed red pepper and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Then add the sherry. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the alcohol has cooked off, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the roasted vegetables, crushed tomatoes and 1 cup chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 minutes.
Add the heavy cream and, using an immersion blender, puree the soup until uniform in texture. Add more chicken stock to adjust the consistency to how you like it.
Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, the oregano, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder in a small bowl and rub the mixture on both sides of the ribs. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a roasting pan, combine the broth and vinegar. Add the ribs to the pan. Cover with foil and tightly seal. Bake 2 hours. Remove the ribs from the pan and place them on a platter. Pour the liquid from the pan into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Add the barbecue sauce.
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium high. Put the ribs on the grill and cook about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and slightly charred. Cut the ribs between the bones and toss them in a large bowl with the sauce. Serve hot.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
Brush the pizza crust lightly with some oil on both sides and put on the prepared baking sheet. Top with the mozzarella, tomatoes, sausage and corn. Bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with the scallion whites and basil, then drizzle with some oil.
Heat electric skillet on medium high setting. Break apart ground beef and add to skillet. Cook for 3 minutes and stir in chopped onion. Cook until the beef is no longer pink. Stir in the chili seasonings and jalapenos and mix well. Add tomatoes and stir to combine. Simmer for 30 minutes on medium heat. Stir in red kidney beans and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. Serve hot with sour cream, grated cheddar cheese, and red onion.
In a wide, shallow glass baking dish, scatter half of the orange slices, half of the onion slices and half of the garlic pieces on the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the steak all over with salt and pepper and put in the dish on top of the orange and onion slices. Scatter the remaining orange, onion and garlic over the steak and pour in the beer and soy sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
Prepare a barbeque on medium-high heat or preheat a broiler. Remove the meat from the marinade and discard the marinade. Grill the steak to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve as desired.
Prepare and preheat your lump charcoal grill to create two heat zones: high and low.
In a small bowl, combine the salt, coriander, chipotle powder, cumin, paprika and mustard powder. Pat the chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with the spice mixture. Rub the exterior of the seasoned chops with the olive oil.
Sear the chops over the hot side of the grill until the exterior forms a nice crust, about 4 minutes per side. Move the pork to the low side of the grill, cover the grill and cook until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes and then serve.
To a large skillet, add the cracked coriander seeds, chipotle powder, cumin powder, smoked paprika and mustard powder. Toast over low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and just toasted, about 3 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, then mix with the salt.
Heat up your grill with lump charcoal, making a hot and a slow zone. Dry the pork chops with paper towels. Evenly sprinkle the pork chops on both sides with the spice mixture.
Drizzle the seasoned pork chops with olive oil, and then place them on the hot side of the grill. Cook for about 8 minutes per side to develop a nice crust, then move to the slow zone of the grill and put the lid down. Continue to cook until the pork chops reach 140 degrees F. Remove to a platter or cutting board. Let the chops rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the zucchini into noodles with a spiral vegetable slicer on the medium setting. Alternatively, use a Japanese mandoline or a sharp chef's knife to cut the zucchini into thin planks, then into strips lengthwise.
Toss the zucchini noodles, corn and cherry tomatoes in a large bowl with the lime juice, garlic and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine, then stir in the dill and feta. Pour into a large serving bowl and serve alongside the pork chops.
Add the garlic, Fresno, olive oil and vinegar to a glass jar with a lid. Season with salt and pepper, then add the mint. Place the lid on and shake vigorously to combine. Set aside.
When ready to serve, combine the watermelon, cucumber and scallions in a large bowl. Dress with the vinaigrette and gently toss to combine. Sprinkle the crumbled feta on top. Serve chilled.
Place the shallot and garlic in a mixing bowl and add a pinch of salt. Add the vinegar and honey and whisk. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil, then add the almonds and mint.
Place the watermelon in a shallow dish. Pour the dressing on top, cover and let marinate 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sear the halloumi 1 minute per side, then remove from the pan; top each with a piece of marinated watermelon.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired.
Toasted Almond Parsley Salad:
Mince the shallot and add to a small bowl. Pour the vinegar over the shallots and add a pinch of salt. Let sit for 30 minutes.
Roughly chop the capers, parsley and almonds and add to the shallots. Add the olive oil, tasting as you go. Mix again and adjust the seasonings.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
For the beef: In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and onions. Cook until starting to soften, then add the ground beef. Cook the meat until it's totally browned, then drain the fat. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper and stir to combine. Add 1/2 cup hot water and stir. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
For the fixins: Meanwhile, wrap the flour tortillas in foil and warm in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Right before serving, crisp the taco shells in the oven according to package instructions.
Serve with the grated cheese, diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.
Preheat the grill to a high heat or light your outdoor grill.
Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper and smear both sides of the steaks with 1/2 stick of the butter.
Grill the steaks until medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side, and then remove from the heat and keep warm. (You can also saute them in a skillet over medium-high heat if you prefer.)
Melt the remaining 1/2 stick of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and then saute the onions until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Pour in the cream, a dash of salt and pepper and the Worcestershire sauce. Let it bubble up, then add the blue cheese and stir together to melt, adding more pepper or Worcestershire sauce as you wish.
Place the steaks on plates and spoon the sauce over the top.
Take a bite. And the world at long last will make sense.
Make the pizza dough: Mix the yeast with 1 1/2 cups warm water and set aside for 8 to 10 minutes. Mix together the flour, olive oil and salt in a bowl using an electric mixer. With the speed on low, drizzle in the yeast/water mixture and mix until totally combined. Cover the bowl with a towel and set in a warm, draft-free place. Allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours.
Pour the black beans into a saucepan. Add the taco seasoning and heat up the beans over medium-low heat. Use a potato masher to mash the beans to the desired texture. Continue cooking/heating over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are no longer runny (they should be the texture of refried beans). Set aside.
In a small skillet, heat the canola oil over medium heat. When hot enough to fry, drop in the tortilla strips in batches, frying them quickly and removing them from the oil with a fork when crisp--30 to 45 seconds per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.
Position an oven rack in the bottom position in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet with some olive oil.
Remove half of the pizza dough from the bowl. (Place the remaining half in a large plastic bag and refrigerate, saving it for another use.) With your hands, spread the dough out on the oiled baking sheet, making sure it's relatively thin. Spread a layer of refried beans all over the pizza crust. Sprinkle the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack over the top. Place the baking sheet on the bottom rack in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, watching to make sure the crust doesn't burn. Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle on the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and cilantro leaves.
Mix together the sour cream and hot sauce in a small bowl, adding enough hot sauce to make the mixture pourable. With a spoon (or you can put it in a pastry bag), drizzle the mixture over the finished pizza.
Sprinkle with the tortilla strips. Cut into squares and serve immediately with good-quality salsa.
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Store in an airtight container. Pack on the dry rub onto your next rack of ribs.
Preheat a grill to high heat.
Place rib-eye steaks on a large platter and season with rub on all sides. Transfer seasoned steaks to the hot grill, and cook for 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare, longer if desired. Remove steaks and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
Rib-eye Rub:
In a small bowl, combine all ingredients, to taste. Adjust the ratio of spices to your preference.
Heat the grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pepperoni and fry, turning as needed, until crisp around the edges, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain; pour off the fat and wipe out the skillet.
Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat. Whisk the eggs and milk in a bowl; add to the skillet and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, running a rubber spatula around the edges and along the bottom to prevent the eggs from sticking, until almost set, 2 to 3 minutes; sprinkle with the cheese, pepperoni and scallion, then cover and remove from the heat to finish cooking, about 1 more minute.
Prepare the ribs (see below). Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, mustard powder and 2 tablespoons salt in a small bowl. Rub the ribs all over with the cut sides of the lemon and then the spice mixture and place in a large roasting pan or resealable plastic bag. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.
Meanwhile, soak the wood chips in water 1 hour, then prepare your grill for smoking, filling the smoker box with one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple.
About 30 minutes before smoking, remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the apple juice, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar in a small spray bottle. Shake to mix.
Once the grill reaches 250 degrees F, lightly brush the grates with vegetable oil and place the ribs on the cooler side of the grill, meat-side up. Spray with the apple juice mixture. Close the grill and let smoke 1 hour.
Replenish the smoker box with another one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple. Flip the ribs so they're meat-side down with the opposite edge of the racks closer to the smoker box. Spray with the apple juice mixture; close the grill and let smoke 1 more hour. Repeat this process every hour until the ribs are dark brown and tender and the meat starts to shrink away from the bones, about 2 more hours. Remove the ribs from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.
How to prep your ribs:
Position the ribs meat-side down. Insert a paring knife under the membrane that covers the back of the rack. Loosen the membrane with the knife. Grab the membrane with your fingers and peel off completely.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
Combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl (I did 30 grinds).
Place the ribs on a piece of foil large enough to fold over and seal, then place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle the dry rub all over the top of the meaty side of the ribs. Wrap the foil around the ribs and seal tightly so that no juices can escape during baking. Bake until the meat is tender and can easily be pulled away from the bones with a fork, about 2 hours.
Heat the BBQ sauce in a small pan over medium heat until warm. Remove the ribs from the oven and open the foil pack. Remove the ribs from the foil and pour any juices that have accumulated into the BBQ sauce and mix to combine. Continue to simmer the sauce until thickened, about 7 minutes.
Heat a grill or grill pan for cooking at medium-high heat.
Slice the ribs into 1-bone pieces. Brush all over with the BBQ sauce. Place the ribs on the grill and cook until grill marks appear, a few minutes on each side. Brush with more BBQ sauce and remove from the heat, then serve with the remaining BBQ sauce on the side.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Arrange the short ribs in a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a small bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients and stir to incorporate. Pour the sauce over ribs and toss well, coating all the pieces. Cover with aluminum foil and roast until cooked through and tender, about 3 hours. Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to brown the top. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.
Begin by making the marinade. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, oil, vinegar, cumin and red pepper flakes. Easy, right?
Sprinkle both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper and place in a re-sealable plastic bag with the marinade. Let rest on the counter for 1 hour. That's easy.
Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Remove the pork chops from the bag and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until the pork chop releases from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another 3 minutes. If using a grill pan, be sure to do in batches so you don't steam the chops. And don't worry if you have neither; you can do this in a pan. See, easy!
For the sauce: Preheat half of a grill to 400 degrees F. Using an upside-down wire cooling rack or a grill basket over the direct-heat side of the grill, add the tomatoes, Thai bird chiles, onions, bell peppers and jalapeno peppers. Roast, tossing and flipping until everything is charred, 20 to 25 minutes.
Boil vegetables: Add the charred vegetables to a medium pot along with the vinegar, sugar, garlic, a pinch of salt and enough water to just cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then blend until smooth. Pass the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer.
For the chicken: Add the chicken, 1/2 cup sauce and vegetable oil to a large resealable bag. Mix and seal, then marinate for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature.
Preheat half of a grill to 400 degrees F.
Remove chicken from bag, discard marinade and pat chicken dry. Place chicken, smooth-side down, over direct heat to char, then flip and finish cooking over indirect heat for a total of 10 to 15 minutes depending on piece and heat. Brush the chicken with sauce the last few minutes of grilling. Serve with more sauce on the side.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the pizza dough and fit it onto a 15-inch pizza pan.
Brown the ground beef in a medium skillet over medium heat, about 10 minutes. Stir in the taco seasoning. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the refried beans and picante sauce until combined. Spread the mixture onto the crust. Scatter the olives over the crust, then top with the cheese and the browned beef. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned.
While the crust is baking, lightly salt the tomatoes, then, in a medium bowl, toss them with the lettuce and sour cream. Once the pizza is out of the oven, top it with the cool lettuce mixture. Slice into eight pieces and serve.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut the bell peppers in half top to bottom and remove the seeds and ribs. Set aside. Cook the rice in a medium saucepan following the package directions.
In a medium skillet, brown the ground beef with the onion and garlic over medium-high heat, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain any excess fat from the meat and remove the skillet from the heat. Combine the ground beef mixture, rice, tomatoes, black pepper and salt in a large bowl and mix until blended.
In a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish, place the bell peppers cut-side up. Evenly divide the beef mixture among the pepper halves. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle the Cheddar on top. Return the pan to the oven, uncovered, and bake until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
Stir together the lime zest, lime juice, sugar and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Add the watermelon, cucumber, mango, jalapeno, onion and basil and toss gently. Chill the salsa until ready to serve.
Add the garlic salt just before serving. Serve with chips.
